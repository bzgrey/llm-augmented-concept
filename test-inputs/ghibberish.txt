Flomperwinks of the highest order gathered beneath the twizzle tree, murmuring about the great Snorfle Parade. “Bibbity-bop!” cried the smallest one, waving a spoon made entirely of moonlight. The others nodded solemnly, for it was well known that nonsense spoken at dawn carried twice the sparkle and half the consequence.

Meanwhile, over the hill and slightly to the left of reason, a herd of plumple beasts practiced synchronized wobbling. Their leader, a particularly pompous flibber named Croom, insisted that every wobble must end with a curtsy and a hum of “doo-da-dee.” The clouds above, offended by such frivolity, decided to rain sideways for a bit — purely out of dramatic flair.

Back in the valley, the Snorfle Parade commenced at precisely almost noon. Drums made of jellybeans boomed while marshmallow trumpets tooted a melody that smelled faintly of cinnamon and regret. A few onlookers clapped in round time (as opposed to square time, which everyone agreed was far too rigid), and someone’s hat floated away, never to be seen or explained again.

By evening, the twizzle tree sighed contentedly, its leaves whispering secret jokes to the stars. Nobody understood them, of course — but that was half the fun.
